//! Performance regression tests for the write/read and compression paths.
//!
//! Two kinds of check, because a wall-clock number means different things in
//! different builds:
//!
//! - **Scaling** — saving and opening ten times the footprints must cost on
//!   the order of ten times the time, in any build on any machine. This is
//!   what catches an accidental quadratic in the OLE writer or the reader,
//!   which is the regression these tests exist for, and it is independent of
//!   how fast the machine happens to be.
//! - **Absolute bounds** — asserted only in an optimised build, where the
//!   paths run well inside the bound and a miss is a real slowdown. An
//!   unoptimised build on a busy shared runner can take longer than any
//!   bound worth having, so there the timings are printed and not asserted.
//!
//! Timings are the minimum over several runs: the minimum is the closest
//! measurement to the code's own cost, while an average carries whatever else
//! the machine was doing.
//!
//! Run with: `cargo test --release --test perf_tests -- --nocapture`
